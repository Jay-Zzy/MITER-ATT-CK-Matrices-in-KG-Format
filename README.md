# MITER-ATT-CK-Matrices-in-KG-Format
Transform MITER ATT&amp;CK Matrices into KG format via Neo4j and py2neo
 
Trough the file "Web Crawler" we get the information of MITER ATT&CK Matrices we want (Tactics, Techniques, Mitigations...)
 
Trough the file "KG-NS" we reform the information and "draw" them in the Neo4j Graph
